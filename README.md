❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Models and Python Libraries

Project Description:

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning–based project that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease using medical and lifestyle parameters. The model is trained on historical healthcare data and uses classification algorithms to make accurate predictions.

This project aims to support early diagnosis and assist doctors or users in taking preventive action by analyzing features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, heart rate, chest pain type, and other clinical indicators.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Build a predictive model for heart disease risk

Compare multiple machine learning algorithms

Improve prediction accuracy using data preprocessing and feature selection

Provide a simple and user-friendly prediction system

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

Different classification models can be trained and compared, such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (optional advanced)

Best model is selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🐍 Python Libraries Used

Data Handling & Processing:

pandas – for dataset loading and manipulation

numpy – for numerical operations

Data Visualization:

matplotlib – charts and plots

seaborn – correlation heatmaps & distribution plots

Machine Learning:

scikit-learn – model training, preprocessing, and evaluation

train_test_split

StandardScaler

classification models

metrics

Optional:

xgboost – for advanced boosting model

joblib / pickle – to save trained model

⚙️ Workflow / Methodology

Data Collection – Use heart disease dataset (like UCI / Kaggle)

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize patterns and correlations

Feature Selection – Choose important health parameters

Data Preprocessing – Encoding + scaling

Model Training – Train multiple ML models

Model Evaluation – Compare performance metrics

Prediction System – Build a simple input-based prediction interface

📊 Output

The system predicts:

Whether a person is likely to have heart disease (Yes/No or Risk Score)
